Using a whiteboard and post-it notes:

1. Draw a 4 box grid
    * x-axis = Interest low to high
    * y-axis = Power low to high
1. Product Owner and team add post-it notes representing key stakeholders and interested parties
1. Align post-its to where you feel the person or team lue in terms of both power and interest
1. Once agreed, create a high-level strategy for engaging with each quadrant:
    * Monitor - Don't burden with too much comms
    * Keep Informed - Regular status updates
    * Keep Satisfied - Give enough information to keep these parties satisfied, watch to see if they move in terms of interest
    * Manage Closely -Engage fully with these parties
