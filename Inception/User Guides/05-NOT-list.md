# The NOT list User Guide
## What is it
The NOT list helps the team understand what's in scope, what's out of scope and what's undecided.

## Why do we need it
It gives the team and stakeholders understanding of what we are attempting to achieve, and equally what we won't.  It also clarifies areas of uncertainty.

## Who uses it
Typically, the NOT List is crafted by the initial team tasked with delivering the project.  This will likely include stakeholders, product owner and members of the initial delivery team.

## How long will it take
Can take minutes to days of elapsed time, especially if there is contentious unresolved scope.  

## How do you do it
My preferred method is to use a whiteboard and post it notes.

1. Draw out the three sections; In Scope, Out of Scope, Unresolved
1. Product Owner and team add post-it notes with items of scope

## Gotchas
* Remember that non-functional scope items exist too.  It's useful to clarify the level of service, stability and performance, especially with MVP (Minimal Viable Product) initiatives.

## Hints and Tip
* Contentious scope can cause delays.  Time-box the process and stick to it.  Any remaining contentious scope debates can be added to the What Keeps Us Up At Night.
